SYSTEMS:
- add simple animation system
- redirect controller input to the open menu
    - character selection menu
    - in game menu
    - main menu etc.
- Y Sort all entities!

MOVEMENT_SYSTEM:
- first immediate later lerped
- take lerp value into consideration when doing collision detection (miner can be partially on multiple tiles and is factored into damage calculation)
- allow left stick for movement
- allow hold for movement

MINER_ANIMATIONS:
- first and most simple idea for the system:
-   states of the miner like (idle, move, attack) that are updated and the input system reacts
-   to the current state so pressing move during a move animation will do nothing,
-   holding move will trigger next move after current move ends
-   some of the moves need state, for example the move and attack animations have a duration
-   I could leave a few slots in MinerData for animation state data
-
- example pressing move button during idle:
- set animation to move, set direction in state
- the render method of the miner reads the state and calculates the offset lerp to the next tile
-

- example:
- specials will later maybe be triggered by holding the special button for some short time,
- the special spawn animation will play and if the button is still down at the end of the animation the
- effect will play. I need then to tune the timings so other players cannot to easily predict specials
- atleast they cannot predict which special, but the cast animation should just be very short


MINER:
- animate miner

OBJECTS:
- add other crystals with cool temporal effects:
    - strength
    - speed
    - luck for finding other crystals

UI/UX
- unify analog and digital movement
- control menus with controller (only the oldest controller?)
- improve crystal count UI

GRID/ARENA:
- prevent player input during TF animation
- add a hand crafted testing arena
- add several types of arenas
- make sure all of them have generic spawn locations
- make hammer hits hit other miners
- appearing blocks (orogeny, kenkmann) must interact with objects:
    -what happens if player stands inside of the created mountain chain?
    a player may take damage and then be inside the mountain, removing the block they got damaged by, this is a cool gameplay mechanic to temporarily capture another player.
    - how are crystals effected, they could either be moved to the next free location or even cooler they could merge with the formed blocks, affecting them. then the crystal is metamorphically transformed and the containing block has much more life so it takes some time to break it and players may fight for the block.

GAMEPLAY:
- MAYBE a very simple exp system to lvl up attacks
-

VFX:
- add some shader to crystals

SPECIAL_ATTACKS:
- implement consumption of specific minerals per special type

MINER HERGARTEN:
    - mass movement?
    - earthquake
    - something with matlap

IMPLEMENTATION OF KENKMANN'S TRANSFORM FAULT:
- instant version works now, needs testing though

- transform particle does the effect after some delay
- look at code from orogeny skill to find location and orientation of the fault line, (xy, o)
- xy is the offset, o is the axis
- visually display the fault line during the delay, maybe particles of debris
- after delay the particle calls the arena method that does all the offsets and damage dealing

MINER PREUSSER:
    ATTACK  - braided river
    DEFENSE - gravel floor (taking damage and slower on gravel)
    SPECIAL - something with glaciers (slippery floor?)
    COMBO   - first gravel floor then braided river, gravel moves and does more damage

PLAYTEST 2311:
- game works for now but somehow is not very fun, atleast with two players
- lack of holding and analog sticks makes gamepad input annoying
- kenkmann skills bring quite a lot of new blocks to the arena
- average rounds took 4 minutes but we did not focus on attacking us melee with the basic swing
- not sure how to proceed now, either add more variety to blocks and improve the arena generation,
    or add a new character for play variety but that probably does not solve the issue that the game
    is not very fun right now.
