MILESTONE NBF:
o fix window size to fit on 1920:1080 beamer screen (needs testing on beamer at home)
o make sure all relevant objects are visually and logically displaced by transform fault



UI/UX:
- place the huds of the miners in a better position that is not overlapping the arena?
- miner direction arrow now sorts behind rockwalls, needs to be rendered on top of arena! (simple fix)

DEBUGGING/TESTING:
- enable keyboard input that populates the new controller state

GAMEPAD SUPPORT:
- improve the hotplugging, disconnect due to battery!
stuff to test:
    - disconnecting controller during a game
    - connect a controller during a game
    - should the remapping of uncontrolled miner and free controller happen automatically?

GRID/ARENA:
- add a hand crafted testing arena
- add several types of arenas
- make sure all of them have generic spawn locations
- appearing blocks (orogeny, kenkmann) must interact with objects:
    -what happens if player stands inside of the created mountain chain?
    a player may take damage and then be inside the mountain, removing the block they got damaged by, this is a cool gameplay mechanic to temporarily capture another player.
    - how are crystals effected, they could either be moved to the next free location or even cooler they could merge with the formed blocks, affecting them. then the crystal is metamorphically transformed and the containing block has much more life so it takes some time to break it and players may fight for the block.

GAMEPLAY:
-

SPECIAL COMBOS:
    - kenkmann hitting crystals with an impact will alter them and give them effectrs

VFX:
- add some shader to crystals (?? david sprites also with shaders?)

MINER HERGARTEN:
    - mass movement?
    - earthquake
    - something with matlap

KENKMANN:
    - IMPACT drops are overpowered. other effect is needed when impact destroys blocks

IMPLEMENTATION OF KENKMANN'S TRANSFORM FAULT:
- instant version works now, needs testing though

- transform particle does the effect after some delay
- look at code from orogeny skill to find location and orientation of the fault line, (xy, o)
- xy is the offset, o is the axis
- visually display the fault line during the delay, maybe particles of debris
- after delay the particle calls the arena method that does all the offsets and damage dealing

BRAIDED RIVER COMBO:
-   braided river increases the speed a melt crystallizes, and will create glass but what effect has glass?
