SYSTEMS:
- Y Sort all entities!

MOVEMENT_SYSTEM:
- take lerp value into consideration when doing collision detection (miner can be partially on multiple tiles and is factored into damage calculation)
- allow left stick for movement
- allow hold for movement
- unify analog and digital movement

- example:
- specials will later maybe be triggered by holding the special button for some short time,
- the special spawn animation will play and if the button is still down at the end of the animation the
- effect will play. I need then to tune the timings so other players cannot to easily predict specials
- atleast they cannot predict which special, but the cast animation should just be very short

MINER:

OBJECTS:
- add other crystals with cool temporal effects:
    - strength
    - speed
    - luck for finding other crystals

UI/UX
- control menus with controller (only the oldest controller?)
- improve crystal count UI

GRID/ARENA:
- prevent player input during TF animation
- add a hand crafted testing arena
- add several types of arenas
- make sure all of them have generic spawn locations
- appearing blocks (orogeny, kenkmann) must interact with objects:
    -what happens if player stands inside of the created mountain chain?
    a player may take damage and then be inside the mountain, removing the block they got damaged by, this is a cool gameplay mechanic to temporarily capture another player.
    - how are crystals effected, they could either be moved to the next free location or even cooler they could merge with the formed blocks, affecting them. then the crystal is metamorphically transformed and the containing block has much more life so it takes some time to break it and players may fight for the block.

GAMEPLAY:
- MAYBE a very simple exp system to lvl up attacks
-

VFX:
- add some shader to crystals

SPECIAL_ATTACKS:
- implement consumption of specific minerals per special type (if multiple minerals are wanted)

MINER HERGARTEN:
    - mass movement?
    - earthquake
    - something with matlap

IMPLEMENTATION OF KENKMANN'S TRANSFORM FAULT:
- instant version works now, needs testing though

- transform particle does the effect after some delay
- look at code from orogeny skill to find location and orientation of the fault line, (xy, o)
- xy is the offset, o is the axis
- visually display the fault line during the delay, maybe particles of debris
- after delay the particle calls the arena method that does all the offsets and damage dealing

MINER PREUSSER:
    ATTACK  - braided river
    DEFENSE - gravel floor (taking damage and slower on gravel)
    SPECIAL - something with glaciers (slippery floor?)
    COMBO   - first gravel floor then braided river, gravel moves and does more damage
    COMBO   - combine gravel and ice so players will move over all gravel tiles and get all the damage

MINER HERGARTEN:
    ATTACK  -
    DEFENSE -
    SPECIAL

IDEAS FOR HERGARTEN SKILLS:
    - something with matlab/code
    - earthquake/tsunami
    - landslide
